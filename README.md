## Introduction 

**THIS IS NOT FINISHED, THAT'S JUST A TEASER FOR THE NEXT VERSION, WHEN EVERYTHING IS DONE THE REPOSITORY WILL BE DELETED AND EVERYTHING WILL BE MOVED [TO THE MAIN ONE](https://github.com/zerinho6/Zerinho6-Bot)**
Zerinho6 Bot is a Lite and fast bot that' focused on personal use but available for a public build, i've been working on it for almost 3 years and because of nice people i'm learning how to make a better code and that's also a reason(not the only or main) for Zerinho6 Bot to be open-source.

## Requirements

-  I recomment **atleast node 10.x.x, [and here's why](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/1386)**

-  A Discord bot account and the bot Token.

-  Git

## Setup

Create a ``.env`` file **via a IDE because you need it to be without name and windows won't let you do that**.

Inside of it, put the follow constants:

```env
TOKEN=Put the Token of your bot here
PREFIX=Put the prefix of your bot here
OWNER=Put your Discord ID here
COOLDOWN=Put how much in milliseconds the bot will take to accept another command after one has been made
LANGUAGE=Put here the main language of the bot(MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE_CODE EXIST ON THE LOCALES FOLDER)
```
Remember, ``.env`` should not have spaces.

Open the console window on the bot folder and type ``npm i``, after that you can do ``node bot.js`` or ``npm test``. There'll be a message on console saying how much time it took to the bot to load and that he's ready.

## Helping

I'll be very happy with any possible help that you want to give to Zerinho6 Bot, but please, make sure you read the Wiki and know how the system works, thank you!!!!

## Translating

You wanna translate you bot to you not-yet-translated language? There's a topic on Wiki saying how you can do that!

## Here's a list of really nice people that made this project possible

**Honux(Backend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me a lot by giving me instructions for literally 2 years about how to make a good code, what I was doing wrong, what I could do and how I can do.

**Skelun(Frontend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me by giving feedback about how a casual user would use Zerinho6 Bot and also helping with the code!

**[Nirewen](https://github.com/nirewen)**: Helped me by saying how x function works or why y thing on Zerinho6 Bot wasn't working.

**[The whole Switchblade Team](https://github.com/orgs/SwitchbladeBot/people)**: A lot of things on Zerinho6 Bot was inspired on [SwitchBlade Bot](https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade).

**[Fernando](https://github.com/fernando4578)**: Helped as much as nirewen giving a lot of help with some function not working, what is cool on code and what isn't, it also helped on the last version of Zerinho6 Bot.

**[Acnologia](https://github.com/Acnologla)**: That's being repetitive but thanks is always needed, the same as Nirewen and Fernando, i would made Zerinho6 Bot TicTacToe based on a version that he made.

**[Mete](https://github.com/metehus), [Tsugami](https://github.com/Tsugami)**: The same as Nirewen, Fernando, Acnologia and Switchblade Team.

**[Smix](https://github.com/smixqse)**: Creator of a old bot called Mixy that doesn't exist anymore, but what started all this Journey.
